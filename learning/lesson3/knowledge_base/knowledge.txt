CMBAgent is a framework specifically designed for scientific discovery, building upon creating a swarm of expert agents.
It includes specific roles like:
- Planner: Breaks down complex problems.
- Engineer: Writes code.
- Executor: Runs code.
- Researcher: Analyzes results.

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a key component, allowing agents to access specialized scientific literature.
